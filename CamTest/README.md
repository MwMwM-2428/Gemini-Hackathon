Bit of some vibe-coding going on.
I wrote a small concept testing Python program here.
I ran it on my WSL distro on Windows, I can't gurantee this works on Mac.

There's an HTML file here.
Run the app.py with python app.py
Then, locally, open the HTML file through a web browser like Microsoft Edge.
It should hopefully work.
Remember to place your own API key inside.
